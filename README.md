# Air FPC Calculatoor

This is the final project from the Front End Development Master offered by the online course provider Start2Impact.

During the course I had the chance to learn HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Webpack and Vite. I decided to complete the course by building a website from scratch using React: a site to calculate the carbon footprint of flights

## Technologies Used

- **React**: for building the user interface
- **Redux**: for managing the application state
- **CSS**: for styling the app
- **React Router**: for navigation between pages
- **GoClimate API**: The GoClimate API uses IATA airport codes of a route to calculate CO2 emissions
